//     var datesThisRound: [Int] = []
//     datesThisRound += [Event.date]
//     // Maybe this^ goes in checkAnswer. Then datesThisRound will be created at the right time and available to be passed into isCorrect. Wait, Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Need to step away.

        }
     
     /*
     let datesThisRound = [an array of the dates of the eventsThisRound]
     
     But should it be created only at the time of checkAnswer()? Since that will reflect the order at that moment.
     If it's created upon the first instantiation of eventsThisRound, then how will it know when the order of eventsThisRound is changed?
     
     But how do I access the date property of each event now that I've separated the event name from the event itself.
     When I move the event names between buttons, there is no longer a link between the actual Event and the name.
     Wait, maybe I preserve the eventsThisRound array, and re-render after every move(if that's even needed.) So each button will increment or decrement the index of its current event.

     2 options from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24602595/extending-array-to-check-if-it-is-sorted-in-swift
     
     Simple:
     extension Array where Element : Comparable {
     func isSorted() -> Bool {
     guard self.count > 1 else {
     return true
     }
     
     for i in 1..<self.count {
     if self[i-1] > self[i] {
     return false
     }
     }
     return true
     }
     }
     
     With arguments for type of sort:
     extension Array where Element: Comparable {
     func isSorted(by isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) -> Bool) -> Bool {
     for i in stride(from: 1, to: self.count, by: 1) {
     if !isOrderedBefore(self[i-1], self[i]) {
     return false
     }
     }
     return true
     }
     }
     
     
     
     
     
     */
    // if historicalEveent1.date > historicalEvent2.date etc. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
}
